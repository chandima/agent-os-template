# Agent-OS Copier Template Repository

This repository hosts multiple Copier templates based on Builder Methods / Agent-OS. Each template flavour is in its own subdirectory under `templates/` and tracks upstream changes automatically.

See `sync-upstream.sh` and `.github/workflows/upstream-sync.yml` for automated upstream sync instructions.
